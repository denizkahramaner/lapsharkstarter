# Hi there!
# These are the settings for Selfstarter.
# This is more tidy than changing the HTML if all you want to do is rename things and swap out images

# You should totally change the HTML and CSS though
# Checkout app/assets/stylesheets/variables.css.scss to change around the CSS quickly

# Set your project goal here - dollar amount
# NOTE: if you manually want to adjust your progress to test the site, head over to the Order model (app/models/order.rb)
project_goal: 30

# If you want to edit the FAQ, head over to app/views/preorder/homepage/_faqs.html.erb

# This'll be both the page title (<title></title>) and the name in the header
product_name: "Lapshark"

# This will be used in sentences like Hooray You've just reserved product_description
product_description: " a half cup of coffee for the Lapshark team to drink during the all nighters they are pulling to deliver Lapshark. From now on, you will be the first to hear of our product release and updates."

# An image showcasing your product -- it'll show up when you pin your product
# It should be in app/assets/images

# If set to true, then the image at "/assets/video_placeholder.png" will be shown in place of the youtube
# video.  When the user clicks it, the vid will replace the image and start playing.
#
# NOTE: you can set this to false, and no image will be use - first frame of the video will be displayed
#
# NOTE: this only works for youtube video at the moment.  If its not for youtube, then just leave this property blank
